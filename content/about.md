Hello! You've found my personal site. As one might assume, I fill it with personal things. I generate this static site with [Hugo](gohugo.io) rather than making it from scratch because _I hate reinventing the wheel._ Though, I've also found that most "reinvented wheels" are born through a surprising lack of basic Googling...

Anyway. Thanks for crawling over!
