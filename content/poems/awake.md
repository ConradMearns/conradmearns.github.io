The storm rolls through
we pick up the broken branches
the pieces of our lives
our crushed dreams
and we move on.

Disasters rarely come in twos
rarely do they come in threes
they come as the torrent
against a young heart
battered to agelessness

I begin my morning with a sunset
I clear the smoke with incense
I dance because I am watching
I cry because I'm just as helpless as anyone
but I can't turn off the radio

And we wonder why god rested on the sabbath.
