I could let you be mine
keep your heart wrapped up in my broken mind
I could give you gifts and words of love
To prove my worth exists far above
Expectations You once had
That fell apart once life with others got bad
I can provide comfort, I can mend wounds
I can keep us tethered, me and you
And when I soar, you may lose
As dependence on me develops a bruise on you
You'll realize the knot I tied was really a noose
And I'll come crashing down, along with you too
And the reasons to stay? They become too few
We will be destroyed, and will need to start anew
And i know but only one thing
your life would be better if I restarted
Without
You
