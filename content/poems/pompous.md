I am my own
That's all that I can be
To try and find the truth?
Such a task seems necessary
But dig too deep
Extrapolate too freely
Your truths become indescribable
As they separate from reality

An old man told truth to the young,
You must be kind
Leave your hatred and quarrels behind

Others say all who are born,
Get what they deserve

But the truth of mother nature?
The truth of father time?
They are too blind
They lack our spines
But they gave us ours
made jester hats of our hearts
Wasted our empathy on the meek
While the truth that we seek
Distances itself while continue to dig deep

You don't understand
As it is, you can't understand
Because as it is
There is nothing to understand
When you wake
If you wake
You'll find that your music is white noise
past your eyelids there is nothing to be seen
And there's nothing but vagueries behind your voice
