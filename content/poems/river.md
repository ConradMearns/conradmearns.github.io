My head is a river
But it's filled up with blood
Overfilling the turns and bends
Until something new restarts the flood
And now I can't feel anymore
No now, I don't feel anything anymore
Until the flood comes and knock me off me feet
Sweeps me to yet another defeat
Where my heart and my head wish that they were both dead
And my body can peacefully swim along
Until all of the pain is gone

My head is a river
And now the flood settles
And I can't find my favorite places anymore
They've been erased, rewritten, ignored
But as long as I stay on this river
And do t get stuck in some oxbow
I'll be safe, free, and you'll know
After I spend some time letting blood go
