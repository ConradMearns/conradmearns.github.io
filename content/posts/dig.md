The Romans were the first of what would become an even larger world. Though only lasting 500 years, they had developed a tight web of new cultural norms and laws, taxes, and courts. Money was tracked in terms of prices and debts, vast mines and aqueducts were constructed.

Decline of literacy

Literacy began to decline, perhaps dramatically, during the socio-political Crisis of the Third Century.[598] Although the Church Fathers were well-educated, they regarded Classical literature as dangerous, if valuable, and reconstrued it through moralizing and allegorical readings. Julian, the only emperor after the conversion of Constantine to reject Christianity, banned Christians from teaching the Classical curriculum, on the grounds that they might corrupt the minds of youth.[590]

While the book roll had emphasized the continuity of the text, the codex format encouraged a "piecemeal" approach to reading by means of citation, fragmented interpretation, and the extraction of maxims.[599] In the 5th and 6th centuries, reading became rarer even for those within the Church hierarchy.[600]

A canal system was built by the Romans in now Jordan. 600,000 cubic meters of stone was carved away for an aqueduct that led to Decapolis. This task only took 120 years to complete. (Having 4 legionares digging would carve 4 inches a day)
