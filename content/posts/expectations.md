In all honesty, few processes of my head are consistent. That being said...

- I do write poetry more often than other things, so expect more of that.
- By having a blog readily available, I might actually contribute...
- There's a lot of Computer Science topics that I want to share.

If you've read my About page then you know that I don't like reinventing wheels. But did you know that I'm also on Medium? ;)

Again, consistency is not a Conrad thing unless I document _everything_ about what I was thinking at the time. So I'll probably be posting personal projects here too in case I ever want to go back to something.
