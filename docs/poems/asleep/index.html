    </header>

    <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to write your thoughts down that way&rdquo; So said the speaker - a very extroverted creature, a conversational exhibitionist with cosmic quandaries boiled down to aether, we spoke but mostly he talked - I said nothing, I wouldn&rsquo;t want my spirits eradicated either. To live in the mind is to live blind - my eyes tied at the lid, tied to the skies were my mysteries hid, how easily could they shatter if I left procrastination for another matter.</p>

<p>I was him and he was me. We had different worlds but felt it wholly. A better form than holy, as wholly connects us by how not what we feel. We both felt that fascination, we both felt our levels of expertise over our past selves. We had learned so so much, in one form or another, and had little time already spent.</p>
