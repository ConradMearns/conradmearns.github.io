      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s cold today
But that&amp;rsquo;s okay
Because even though the leaves and I are falling
This autumn weather is still soft and charming
As time moves forward it does less and less harming
And things move towards harmony
I remember the old days
Those November/December cold days
When we&amp;rsquo;d walk and shiver in the winter haze
Before we ever used a word like bae
The nostalgia came and hit me hard</description>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t drink so much coffee
Before you try and sleep
You&amp;rsquo;re mind will race with thoughts
Stuck on repeat
Stuck on repeat
Stuck on repeat
And you won&amp;rsquo;t be scared
But you&amp;rsquo;ll jerk awake
Making an audible gasp for air
Stuck on repeat
On repeat
On repeat
Thoughts race faster
Like a river during downpour
Yet they go nowhere
Stuck
This is is why you
Repeat</description>

      <description>sunsets seen
though never captured
a time capsule in a ghost town
a snowflake that never meets the snow
holding your breath
when your house is a vacuum
all that was meant
but could not make it
and not because it couldn&amp;rsquo;t have tried</description>

      <description>Through the gold tinted glass, the man nodded his head, so I did too</description>

      <title>Beautiful</title>

      <description>I want to make something beautiful
I want to be something beautiful
But there&amp;rsquo;s nothing inside me
No hint towards creativity
No passion
No pain
No hope to change
Just damned up tears
All of my magnified fears
Can these words really express me?
Break apart the walls in my head
And relieve me of this anxiety?
So terrified of society
I&amp;rsquo;ll just put the walls back up</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m terrified of the next me
And what he will do
In the ways that he does nothing</description>

      <description>Two pills
Pop them
Crawl in
Warm bed
Empty head
Dreams of dread?
They&amp;rsquo;re all dead
But I&amp;rsquo;m not
Done growing
I keep showing
Myself I can change
Thoughts rearrange
Sometimes derange
Derail, a torn sail
Cannot bail
From this ship
I&amp;rsquo;m the captain
And the arsonist
Who started this
Fantastic mess
You thought I would accomplish less?
That low bar is a personal best
That I keep setting
Lower</description>

      <title>Asleep</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to write your thoughts down that way&amp;rdquo; So said the speaker - a very extroverted creature, a conversational exhibitionist with cosmic quandaries boiled down to aether, we spoke but mostly he talked - I said nothing, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want my spirits eradicated either. To live in the mind is to live blind - my eyes tied at the lid, tied to the skies were my mysteries hid, how easily could they shatter if I left procrastination for another matter.</description>
