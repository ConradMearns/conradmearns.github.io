      <title>Old Snow</title>
      <link>http://conrads.website/poems/old_snow/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s cold today&lt;br /&gt;
But that&amp;rsquo;s okay&lt;br /&gt;
Because even though the leaves and I are falling&lt;br /&gt;
This autumn weather is still soft and charming&lt;br /&gt;
As time moves forward it does less and less harming&lt;br /&gt;
And things move towards harmony&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember the old days&lt;br /&gt;
Those November/December cold days&lt;br /&gt;
When we&amp;rsquo;d walk and shiver in the winter haze&lt;br /&gt;
Before we ever used a word like bae&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nostalgia came and hit me hard&lt;br /&gt;
Gave me the energy to write these bars&lt;br /&gt;
And the memories of junk food dates in my car&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s heartbreaking that we&amp;rsquo;ve become so far&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are still traces of you wherever I go&lt;br /&gt;
Emotions captured by falling leaves and snow&lt;br /&gt;
But now that we can open up to talk&lt;br /&gt;
I can finally let the grieving go&lt;br /&gt;
As long you are doing okay, and that I know&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t drink so much coffee&lt;br /&gt;
Before you try and sleep&lt;br /&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;re mind will race with thoughts&lt;br /&gt;
Stuck on repeat&lt;br /&gt;
Stuck on repeat&lt;br /&gt;
Stuck on repeat&lt;br /&gt;
And you won&amp;rsquo;t be scared&lt;br /&gt;
But you&amp;rsquo;ll jerk awake&lt;br /&gt;
Making an audible gasp for air&lt;br /&gt;
Stuck on repeat&lt;br /&gt;
On repeat&lt;br /&gt;
On repeat&lt;br /&gt;
Thoughts race faster&lt;br /&gt;
Like a river during downpour&lt;br /&gt;
Yet they go nowhere&lt;br /&gt;
Stuck&lt;br /&gt;
This is is why you&lt;br /&gt;
Repeat&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;sunsets seen&lt;br /&gt;
though never captured&lt;br /&gt;
a time capsule in a ghost town&lt;br /&gt;
a snowflake that never meets the snow&lt;br /&gt;
holding your breath&lt;br /&gt;
when your house is a vacuum&lt;br /&gt;
all that was meant&lt;br /&gt;
but could not make it&lt;br /&gt;
and not because it couldn&amp;rsquo;t have tried&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gold Tinted Glass</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Through the gold tinted glass, the man nodded his head, so I did too&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Beautiful</title>
      <link>http://conrads.website/poems/beautiful/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I want to make something beautiful&lt;br /&gt;
I want to be something beautiful&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;rsquo;s nothing inside me&lt;br /&gt;
No hint towards creativity&lt;br /&gt;
No passion&lt;br /&gt;
No pain&lt;br /&gt;
No hope to change&lt;br /&gt;
Just damned up tears&lt;br /&gt;
All of my magnified fears&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can these words really express me?&lt;br /&gt;
Break apart the walls in my head&lt;br /&gt;
And relieve me of this anxiety?&lt;br /&gt;
So terrified of society&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll just put the walls back up&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Next Me</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m terrified of the next me&lt;br /&gt;
And what he will do&lt;br /&gt;
In the ways that he does nothing&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two pills&lt;br /&gt;
Pop them&lt;br /&gt;
Crawl in&lt;br /&gt;
Warm bed&lt;br /&gt;
Empty head&lt;br /&gt;
Dreams of dread?&lt;br /&gt;
They&amp;rsquo;re all dead&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;rsquo;m not&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Done growing&lt;br /&gt;
I keep showing&lt;br /&gt;
Myself I can change&lt;br /&gt;
Thoughts rearrange&lt;br /&gt;
Sometimes derange&lt;br /&gt;
Derail, a torn sail&lt;br /&gt;
Cannot bail&lt;br /&gt;
From this ship&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m the captain&lt;br /&gt;
And the arsonist&lt;br /&gt;
Who started this&lt;br /&gt;
Fantastic mess&lt;br /&gt;
You thought I would accomplish less?&lt;br /&gt;
That low bar is a personal best&lt;br /&gt;
That I keep setting&lt;br /&gt;
Lower&lt;br /&gt;
And lower&lt;br /&gt;
Thought I&amp;rsquo;d be the limbo king by now&lt;br /&gt;
But all I wear are khakis and a plastic crown&lt;br /&gt;
Fishhooks in my cheeks to prevent a frown&lt;br /&gt;
From showing&lt;br /&gt;
Not done growing&lt;br /&gt;
I still change&lt;br /&gt;
I can&amp;rsquo;t be the same&lt;br /&gt;
As my old self&lt;br /&gt;
And my health&lt;br /&gt;
Neither rises&lt;br /&gt;
Or lowers&lt;br /&gt;
These lures&lt;br /&gt;
Keep catching me&lt;br /&gt;
Still got the hooks as you can see&lt;br /&gt;
Getting pulled in every which way direction&lt;br /&gt;
Cant form a proper sentence&lt;br /&gt;
Or ask a simple question&lt;br /&gt;
Most of the time&lt;br /&gt;
Yet I can still bust rhyme&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s my way to pass the time&lt;br /&gt;
And I seem to do it fairly fine&lt;br /&gt;
Which is nice cuz it don&amp;rsquo;t cost me a dime&lt;br /&gt;
But it cost me my life&lt;br /&gt;
Working on things I think are important&lt;br /&gt;
Create code to capture meaning then store it&lt;br /&gt;
Stashed away from any who&amp;rsquo;d whore it&lt;br /&gt;
Out, to those who would misuse it&lt;br /&gt;
Rip the meaning right out of it&amp;rsquo;s socket&lt;br /&gt;
Like isolated islands bought by cruise ships&lt;br /&gt;
Old songs being turned into shitty pop hits&lt;br /&gt;
Knockoff brands for the poor misfits&lt;br /&gt;
Misinformation for the dumb and half wits&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Asleep</title>
      <link>http://conrads.website/poems/asleep/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to write your thoughts down that way&amp;rdquo; So said the speaker - a very extroverted creature, a conversational exhibitionist with cosmic quandaries boiled down to aether, we spoke but mostly he talked - I said nothing, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want my spirits eradicated either. To live in the mind is to live blind - my eyes tied at the lid, tied to the skies were my mysteries hid, how easily could they shatter if I left procrastination for another matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was him and he was me. We had different worlds but felt it wholly. A better form than holy, as wholly connects us by how not what we feel. We both felt that fascination, we both felt our levels of expertise over our past selves. We had learned so so much, in one form or another, and had little time already spent.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pompous</title>
      <link>http://conrads.website/poems/pompous/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am my own&lt;br /&gt;
That&amp;rsquo;s all that I can be&lt;br /&gt;
To try and find the truth?&lt;br /&gt;
Such a task seems necessary&lt;br /&gt;
But dig too deep&lt;br /&gt;
Extrapolate too freely&lt;br /&gt;
Your truths become indescribable&lt;br /&gt;
As they separate from reality&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An old man told truth to the young,&lt;br /&gt;
You must be kind&lt;br /&gt;
Leave your hatred and quarrels behind&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others say all who are born,&lt;br /&gt;
Get what they deserve&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the truth of mother nature?&lt;br /&gt;
The truth of father time?&lt;br /&gt;
They are too blind&lt;br /&gt;
They lack our spines&lt;br /&gt;
But they gave us ours&lt;br /&gt;
made jester hats of our hearts&lt;br /&gt;
Wasted our empathy on the meek&lt;br /&gt;
While the truth that we seek&lt;br /&gt;
Distances itself while continue to dig deep&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t understand&lt;br /&gt;
As it is, you can&amp;rsquo;t understand&lt;br /&gt;
Because as it is&lt;br /&gt;
There is nothing to understand&lt;br /&gt;
When you wake&lt;br /&gt;
If you wake&lt;br /&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ll find that your music is white noise&lt;br /&gt;
past your eyelids there is nothing to be seen&lt;br /&gt;
And there&amp;rsquo;s nothing but vagueries behind your voice&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Awake</title>
      <link>http://conrads.website/poems/awake/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The storm rolls through&lt;br /&gt;
we pick up the broken branches&lt;br /&gt;
the pieces of our lives&lt;br /&gt;
our crushed dreams&lt;br /&gt;
and we move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disasters rarely come in twos&lt;br /&gt;
rarely do they come in threes&lt;br /&gt;
they come as the torrent&lt;br /&gt;
against a young heart&lt;br /&gt;
battered to agelessness&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I begin my morning with a sunset&lt;br /&gt;
I clear the smoke with incense&lt;br /&gt;
I dance because I am watching&lt;br /&gt;
I cry because I&amp;rsquo;m just as helpless as anyone&lt;br /&gt;
but I can&amp;rsquo;t turn off the radio&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we wonder why god rested on the sabbath.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>River</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My head is a river&lt;br /&gt;
But it&amp;rsquo;s filled up with blood&lt;br /&gt;
Overfilling the turns and bends&lt;br /&gt;
Until something new restarts the flood&lt;br /&gt;
And now I can&amp;rsquo;t feel anymore&lt;br /&gt;
No now, I don&amp;rsquo;t feel anything anymore&lt;br /&gt;
Until the flood comes and knock me off me feet&lt;br /&gt;
Sweeps me to yet another defeat&lt;br /&gt;
Where my heart and my head wish that they were both dead&lt;br /&gt;
And my body can peacefully swim along&lt;br /&gt;
Until all of the pain is gone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My head is a river&lt;br /&gt;
And now the flood settles&lt;br /&gt;
And I can&amp;rsquo;t find my favorite places anymore&lt;br /&gt;
They&amp;rsquo;ve been erased, rewritten, ignored&lt;br /&gt;
But as long as I stay on this river&lt;br /&gt;
And do t get stuck in some oxbow&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ll be safe, free, and you&amp;rsquo;ll know&lt;br /&gt;
After I spend some time letting blood go&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I Could...</title>

      <guid>http://conrads.website/poems/i_could/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I could let you be mine&lt;br /&gt;
keep your heart wrapped up in my broken mind&lt;br /&gt;
I could give you gifts and words of love&lt;br /&gt;
To prove my worth exists far above&lt;br /&gt;
Expectations You once had&lt;br /&gt;
That fell apart once life with others got bad&lt;br /&gt;
I can provide comfort, I can mend wounds&lt;br /&gt;
I can keep us tethered, me and you&lt;br /&gt;
And when I soar, you may lose&lt;br /&gt;
As dependence on me develops a bruise on you&lt;br /&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ll realize the knot I tied was really a noose&lt;br /&gt;
And I&amp;rsquo;ll come crashing down, along with you too&lt;br /&gt;
And the reasons to stay? They become too few&lt;br /&gt;
We will be destroyed, and will need to start anew&lt;br /&gt;
And i know but only one thing&lt;br /&gt;
your life would be better if I restarted&lt;br /&gt;
Without&lt;br /&gt;
You&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chatter</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Digital chit chatter&lt;br /&gt;
Wired rant and banter&lt;br /&gt;
A conflict comes&lt;br /&gt;
A conflict goes&lt;br /&gt;
And my solution arrives after&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital chit chatter&lt;br /&gt;
On ideas that don&amp;rsquo;t matter&lt;br /&gt;
A thought crosses my mind&lt;br /&gt;
And here it will hide&lt;br /&gt;
To stay forever after&lt;/p&gt;
