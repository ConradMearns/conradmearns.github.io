      <title>Old Snow</title>
      <link>http://conrads.website/poems/old_snow/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s cold today&lt;br /&gt;
But that&amp;rsquo;s okay&lt;br /&gt;
Because even though the leaves and I are falling&lt;br /&gt;
This autumn weather is still soft and charming&lt;br /&gt;
As time moves forward it does less and less harming&lt;br /&gt;
And things move towards harmony&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember the old days&lt;br /&gt;
Those November/December cold days&lt;br /&gt;
When we&amp;rsquo;d walk and shiver in the winter haze&lt;br /&gt;
Before we ever used a word like bae&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nostalgia came and hit me hard&lt;br /&gt;
Gave me the energy to write these bars&lt;br /&gt;
And the memories of junk food dates in my car&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s heartbreaking that we&amp;rsquo;ve become so far&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are still traces of you wherever I go&lt;br /&gt;
Emotions captured by falling leaves and snow&lt;br /&gt;
But now that we can open up to talk&lt;br /&gt;
I can finally let the grieving go&lt;br /&gt;
As long you are doing okay, and that I know&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pawn</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now that I am free of that world&lt;br /&gt;
I am alone in a new one&lt;br /&gt;
Everything is a copy of what it once was&lt;br /&gt;
And I am merely a pawn&lt;br /&gt;
But a pawn with confidence&lt;br /&gt;
Is a pawn that understands death&lt;br /&gt;
Not as a tragedy, but as a choice&lt;br /&gt;
The power to make one sacrifice&lt;br /&gt;
So everyone else can do their best&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t drink so much coffee&lt;br /&gt;
Before you try and sleep&lt;br /&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;re mind will race with thoughts&lt;br /&gt;
Stuck on repeat&lt;br /&gt;
Stuck on repeat&lt;br /&gt;
Stuck on repeat&lt;br /&gt;
And you won&amp;rsquo;t be scared&lt;br /&gt;
But you&amp;rsquo;ll jerk awake&lt;br /&gt;
Making an audible gasp for air&lt;br /&gt;
Stuck on repeat&lt;br /&gt;
On repeat&lt;br /&gt;
On repeat&lt;br /&gt;
Thoughts race faster&lt;br /&gt;
Like a river during downpour&lt;br /&gt;
Yet they go nowhere&lt;br /&gt;
Stuck&lt;br /&gt;
This is is why you&lt;br /&gt;
Repeat&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Destined</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;sunsets seen&lt;br /&gt;
though never captured&lt;br /&gt;
a time capsule in a ghost town&lt;br /&gt;
a snowflake that never meets the snow&lt;br /&gt;
holding your breath&lt;br /&gt;
when your house is a vacuum&lt;br /&gt;
all that was meant&lt;br /&gt;
but could not make it&lt;br /&gt;
and not because it couldn&amp;rsquo;t have tried&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Through the gold tinted glass, the man nodded his head, so I did too&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Beautiful</title>
      <link>http://conrads.website/poems/beautiful/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I want to make something beautiful&lt;br /&gt;
I want to be something beautiful&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;rsquo;s nothing inside me&lt;br /&gt;
No hint towards creativity&lt;br /&gt;
No passion&lt;br /&gt;
No pain&lt;br /&gt;
No hope to change&lt;br /&gt;
Just damned up tears&lt;br /&gt;
All of my magnified fears&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can these words really express me?&lt;br /&gt;
Break apart the walls in my head&lt;br /&gt;
And relieve me of this anxiety?&lt;br /&gt;
So terrified of society&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll just put the walls back up&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Next Me</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m terrified of the next me&lt;br /&gt;
And what he will do&lt;br /&gt;
In the ways that he does nothing&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two pills&lt;br /&gt;
Pop them&lt;br /&gt;
Crawl in&lt;br /&gt;
Warm bed&lt;br /&gt;
Empty head&lt;br /&gt;
Dreams of dread?&lt;br /&gt;
They&amp;rsquo;re all dead&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;rsquo;m not&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Done growing&lt;br /&gt;
I keep showing&lt;br /&gt;
Myself I can change&lt;br /&gt;
Thoughts rearrange&lt;br /&gt;
Sometimes derange&lt;br /&gt;
Derail, a torn sail&lt;br /&gt;
Cannot bail&lt;br /&gt;
From this ship&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m the captain&lt;br /&gt;
And the arsonist&lt;br /&gt;
Who started this&lt;br /&gt;
Fantastic mess&lt;br /&gt;
You thought I would accomplish less?&lt;br /&gt;
That low bar is a personal best&lt;br /&gt;
That I keep setting&lt;br /&gt;
Lower&lt;br /&gt;
And lower&lt;br /&gt;
Thought I&amp;rsquo;d be the limbo king by now&lt;br /&gt;
But all I wear are khakis and a plastic crown&lt;br /&gt;
Fishhooks in my cheeks to prevent a frown&lt;br /&gt;
From showing&lt;br /&gt;
Not done growing&lt;br /&gt;
I still change&lt;br /&gt;
I can&amp;rsquo;t be the same&lt;br /&gt;
As my old self&lt;br /&gt;
And my health&lt;br /&gt;
Neither rises&lt;br /&gt;
Or lowers&lt;br /&gt;
These lures&lt;br /&gt;
Keep catching me&lt;br /&gt;
Still got the hooks as you can see&lt;br /&gt;
Getting pulled in every which way direction&lt;br /&gt;
Cant form a proper sentence&lt;br /&gt;
Or ask a simple question&lt;br /&gt;
Most of the time&lt;br /&gt;
Yet I can still bust rhyme&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s my way to pass the time&lt;br /&gt;
And I seem to do it fairly fine&lt;br /&gt;
Which is nice cuz it don&amp;rsquo;t cost me a dime&lt;br /&gt;
But it cost me my life&lt;br /&gt;
Working on things I think are important&lt;br /&gt;
Create code to capture meaning then store it&lt;br /&gt;
Stashed away from any who&amp;rsquo;d whore it&lt;br /&gt;
Out, to those who would misuse it&lt;br /&gt;
Rip the meaning right out of it&amp;rsquo;s socket&lt;br /&gt;
Like isolated islands bought by cruise ships&lt;br /&gt;
Old songs being turned into shitty pop hits&lt;br /&gt;
Knockoff brands for the poor misfits&lt;br /&gt;
Misinformation for the dumb and half wits&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Asleep</title>
      <link>http://conrads.website/poems/asleep/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to write your thoughts down that way&amp;rdquo; So said the speaker - a very extroverted creature, a conversational exhibitionist with cosmic quandaries boiled down to aether, we spoke but mostly he talked - I said nothing, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want my spirits eradicated either. To live in the mind is to live blind - my eyes tied at the lid, tied to the skies were my mysteries hid, how easily could they shatter if I left procrastination for another matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was him and he was me. We had different worlds but felt it wholly. A better form than holy, as wholly connects us by how not what we feel. We both felt that fascination, we both felt our levels of expertise over our past selves. We had learned so so much, in one form or another, and had little time already spent.&lt;/p&gt;
