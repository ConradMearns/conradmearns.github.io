      <h1>Starlings</h1>
    </header>

    <p>I smile at the woman that happens to pass me by<br />
her head drops suddenly<br />
as if my glare was a guillotine<br />
or if I was made of something putrid<br />
I cannot blame her<br />
what if I was?<br />
something putrid</p>

<p>The images dance in my head<br />
with the grace of starlings they move<br />
so fast I cannot catch<br />
what they did with that bat<br />
a starling mimics her voice over the phone<br />
blood<br />
blood<br />
blood<br />
she doesn&rsquo;t remember me<br />
her starlings have become a hurricane<br />
ripping her mind apart<br />
while mine mimic the pain<br />
to the starling: &ldquo;i have enough of my own pain, please not now&rdquo;<br />
the starlings stare at me<br />
even the thought of trying to empty my head<br />
brings the starlings, brings the dread<br />
we think the drug was ketamine<br />
after 3 months, it&rsquo;s to tell if you know what i mean<br />
though the holes in her arms were still a bit aparant<br />
she was too afraid at the time to get a rape kit<br />
they knew where she lived<br />
they visited her there<br />
but all she recalled were nightmares<br />
but they matched the stains<br />
they matched the pain<br />
her reality was being torn apart<br />
it made her insane<br />
we&rsquo;d call every night<br />
from 5 to 2, she would only be herself<br />
for a few minutes<br />
maybe a hour<br />
I let my life fall apart<br />
because i loved her</p>

<p>she escaped<br />
and I checked in<br />
to the loony bin<br />
my brain has always been broken<br />
so now when im scared i think of the faceless<br />
what they did what that bat<br />
what I want to do right right back<br />
my dreams have been taken over<br />
my trust has been destroyed<br />
my anxiety is catalyst for the rage they&rsquo;ve deployed</p>

<p>but i hear he&rsquo;s in another country<br />
and she doesn&rsquo;t want to go back<br />
to meet with the school and authorities per invite<br />
i cant fucking blame her</p>
