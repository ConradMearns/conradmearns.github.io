      <description>Physical Build The physical considerations of the project must meet needs of future-proofing, cost, and setup time requirements. The aim of such a project would be to achieve:
 Reliable, RAID-like cloud storage and computing
 Cheap storage
 Expandability
 Intelligent software design
  Cluster Hat The Cluster Hat is a deivce that connects multiple Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s together rather simply and gracefully. It connects and powers the Zero&amp;rsquo;s mini USB port, and evern includes a software bundle.</description>

      <description>I cannot say that my mind is focused
I cannot say that my mind is distracted
nor blinded, bewildered, hindered or strained
but I cannot say my mind is focused
I wonder what tomorrow holds, and I wonder I will feel.
I am the calm sea, and the captain which sails upon it. I am the lazy driver behind the car, and I am the car. I see all that is to be, all the must be down, and I have no intention of doing it.</description>

      <description>Well I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty busy recently, as the semester winds down the workload typically ramps up&amp;hellip; So it goes.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to find the time to write here more, and sometimes I have. It&amp;rsquo;s just that so many of my words end up being for me and me alone, and because of that this place continues to look empty&amp;hellip;
Well, to help fight the emptiness, here are some shell renders I did.</description>

      <description>In Seashells: The Plainness and Beauty of their Mathematical Description, Jorge Picado describes the mathematics necessary to simulate the shape of a multitude of different seashells. In this post, I wanted to share some renders I created while implementing Picado&amp;rsquo;s math into SciView and how the fourteen parameters function.
Defining the Spiral The parameters D, A, alpha and beta allow us to construct any variety of spiral we want.</description>

      <description>I always find myself here. Laying in bed, waiting for the day to roll over as I do. Twisting and turning, I can never find the right position to begin falling asleep. Though my eyes can barely lift their lids, my head isn&amp;rsquo;t ready to call it quits - for today that is.
I always find myself here. Fingers on keys, eyes on the screen, though it keeps burning. I write my stream of thoughts into ones and zeros, kept understandable by the unicode standard (at least a little).</description>

      <description>In all honesty, few processes of my head are consistent. That being said&amp;hellip;
 I do write poetry more often than other things, so expect more of that.
 By having a blog readily available, I might actually contribute&amp;hellip;
 There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of Computer Science topics that I want to share.
  If you&amp;rsquo;ve read my About page then you know that I don&amp;rsquo;t like reinventing wheels. But did you know that I&amp;rsquo;m also on Medium?</description>
